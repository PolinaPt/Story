Similar to the contextual text color classes, set the background of an element to any contextual class. Background utilities do not set color, so in some cases you’ll want to use .text-* color utilities.

Background utilities like .bg-* that generated from our original $theme-colors Sass map don’t yet respond to color modes, however, any .bg-*-subtle utility will. This will be resolved in v6.
